//This is just a place where I can just plan out what I am wanting to do to MyBJJ

//MARK: - BETA FEEDBACK
/*
 Some people have recorded that they, when they log a submission it doesn't appear in either the sublist or in stats.

 Something that wasn't listed as needed doing was adding in a support section. I have recently add in a support button with in the profile view for users to send an email straight through to support. This could be for anything, it is a mailto link. ✅ 01/08/22

//MARK: - NOTES ADDED | 28/07/22
//MARK: - TO COME TO FIREBASE & USER ACCOUNTS
/*
 
 I want to add a way for users to save their belt rank. I also want to catalog the submissions people are cataloging with their respective belt rank. This will add for even more stat break down for the future of MyBJJ. Along with this addition I am going to start working on adding in some
 
 1. Adding in Gi, allowing the user to record submission that where performed in Gi.✅
    *Idea for the picker, making the picker use images instead of using text.*
 
 2. Saving Belt Rank, Saving belt rank to either the user or use it as a modifier for thier submissions that they log. E.g (1 rear naked - Blue belt 2 stripe). This would allow people to filter for submissions performed at different belt ranks.

//MARK: - TO COME TO NewSkillView
/*
 
 For this view and the changes I am wanting to bring to the user via firebase. I will have to also have to add in a new selection where they can choose, either Gi or No Gi. This is so went saving to Firebase I will be able to then filter or search for only gi or nogi submissions.
 
 1. Add Gi or No Gi picker. This would just add something to the saved files to show if it was Gi or No Gi.✅
 
 
 */

//MARK: - TO COME TO SubListView
/*
 
 In sublistview there are several things that will have to happen once I have added in all of the above functionality. I will be changing the little man I have displaying where on the body the submission was performed, it will be change to a figure with a gi on for Gi submissions. I am also thinking.... Should I add a little colour label depicting what belt rank the submission was performed at. I am not sure how much bigger I am wanting to make the current list items, but I guess I'll do some testing and find out.
 
 1. Display Gi or No Gi figure. This will make it easy for the user to be able to tell whether the submission was performed in gi or no gi. ✅ 31/07/22 (This has been completed but will now need to add in some functionality to make app differ from gi and no gi. This will let let it know which sublistviewItem to append to the list.)
 
 2. Display current belt rank. This would be to show what belt rank the user was when they logged the submission.
 
 3. Make a Function to be able to choose between either gi or no gi when setting a new skill. Then log them accordingly into the list.
 
 */

//MARK: - TO COME TO StatsView
/*
 For StatsView I am also wanting to add some stats to display for the user whether it be for gi or for no gi. Give them a basic break down of what they have done either gi or no gi.
 
 1. Display a pi charts for Gi. This will be the only addition for now, I am going to expand on this in the near future.
